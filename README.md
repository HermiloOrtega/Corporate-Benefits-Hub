The concept behind Agenda Comercial was to create a centralized platform that:
- Allows employees to browse different categories of businesses offering exclusive promotions.
- Provides detailed pages for each business showcasing the available promotions.
- Features an engaging homepage with a slider displaying designs and promotions from these businesses.

## Features & Functionality
- **Main Menu:** Lists all business categories for quick and easy navigation.
- **Business Listings:** Each category displays a list of businesses along with their promotions.
- **Homepage Slider:** A dynamic slider that showcases designs and promotions from various businesses.
- **Dynamic Book Agenda:** An interactive, realistic book-like experience that displays promotional flyers with page-flipping effects.
- **Customization:** Small, user-focused customizations were implemented to enhance the overall experience.

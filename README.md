# 📦 Corporate Benefits Hub

## 🧭 Overview  
**Corporate Benefits Hub** is a secure, intranet-based web application designed to centralize and showcase exclusive employee benefits, discounts, and corporate partnerships. Deployed on internal Windows Servers, this system provides an interactive and visual experience for employees to explore perks by category, vendor, and promotional format.

What began as a front-end assignment during my first internship evolved into a full-cycle project under my ownership—bridging UX design, custom page development, Flash-based prototyping, and stakeholder alignment with executive leadership.

## 💡 Idea & Concept  
The project was envisioned to:
- Provide a modernized, employee-friendly benefits portal beyond simple static pages.
- Replace flat links and PDF listings with an engaging, navigable experience.
- Offer **interactive promotion discovery**—tailored to company partnerships and vendor categories.

A standout innovation was the **Dynamic Book Agenda**, which replaced traditional link-heavy navigation with an intuitive, book-like UI built using Adobe Flash—creating a highly immersive experience.

## ✨ Features & Functionality  
- **Business Directory by Category**  
- **Vendor Detail Pages** with rich media content (flyers, videos, GIFs)  
- **Homepage Carousel Slider** featuring top promotions  
- **Dynamic Book Agenda** with:
  - Page-flip animation
  - Alphabetized index navigation
  - Grid view, two-page mode
  - Zoom controls
  - Export single-page option  
- **Interactive Media Modals** to display PDFs, videos, and dynamic content without leaving the main screen  
- **Employee-Centric UI** with large buttons, visual categories, and responsive interactions

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Dynamic Components**: Adobe Flash (customized project base)  
- **Backend/Hosting**: Static hosting on internal Windows Server (IIS)  
- **Design Tools**: Adobe Photoshop for all visual assets  

## 🏗 Architecture & Design  
- Modular architecture with easily extendable business categories  
- Flash-based book viewer decoupled from core navigation for performance and isolation  
- Asset loader and modal system to support PDFs, videos, and image content  
- Internal-only deployment via company intranet for secure access

## 🚀 Installation & Setup  
- **Environment**: On-prem Windows Servers, Flash-enabled environment  
- **Access**: Restricted to company network  
- **Deployment**: Managed by the internal IT department with developer-authored configs  

> **Note**: Flash-based features are legacy and marked for replacement in future modernization efforts.

## 🧑‍💻 My Role & Contributions  
This project was my **first hands-on software development experience**, where I:
- 🚀 Evolved from minor UI tweaks to full project ownership  
- 🎨 Designed all visuals: category buttons, vendor tiles, modal layouts  
- 🧩 Built custom HTML modals to handle PDFs, videos, and GIFs within the UI  
- 🔄 Reverse-engineered and customized an Adobe Flash template to deliver the book experience  
- 🔧 Developed custom JS/CSS logic for interactive navigation and content loading  
- 🤝 Acted as the bridge between design, development, and department leadership  
- 🧠 Learned directly under a senior software engineer until I was entrusted with full ownership  

## 🧗 Challenges & Learnings  
- 🌐 Learned front-end development from scratch (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
- 📚 Self-taught Adobe Flash to deliver an executive-requested feature  
- 🎯 Designed with usability in mind, optimizing layout for non-technical users  
- 🧠 Absorbed critical software engineering foundations through mentorship  
- 🔄 Balanced creative design and business constraints under real production deadlines  

## 📈 Future Enhancements  
- Replace Flash with HTML5 or WebGL viewer  
- Make fully responsive for mobile use  
- Expand vendor integration and media types  
- Add login-level personalization (e.g., saving favorites)

## 💡 Idea & Concept
The concept behind Agenda Comercial was to create a centralized platform that:

- Allows employees to browse different categories of businesses offering exclusive promotions.
- Provides detailed pages for each business showcasing the available promotions.
- Features an engaging homepage with a slider displaying designs and promotions from these businesses.

An innovative component of the project is the Dynamic Book Agenda, which uses Adobe Flash to simulate a realistic book experience with page-flipping effects.
